And if you do attempt that dish and fail spectacularly, we're not going to tsk-tsk you—because we've had plenty of OH, S#!T moments, too. That's not to say we're not serious about food. If you've come here to finally tackle an exasperatingly intense sourdough recipe, we can help explain the technique, step by step. We celebrate anyone who really loves to eat as much as those who actually get in the kitchen to cook. So wherever you fall on that spectrum, you'll find your people here.
