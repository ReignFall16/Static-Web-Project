            <h2 id="test76">Bulalo</h2>
            <p id="pp">The perfect company for a cool, rainy day in the Philippines is a nice hot bowl of bulalo. This tasty soup is made by slow-cooking beef shanks and bone marrow (still in the bone) in some water with fish sauce, onions, and peppercorn, and later adding in some vegetables. Especially known for this dish is the province of Batangas in the country’s Southern Luzon region.</p>

            <h2 id="test79">Sisig</h2>
            <p id="ii">Served sizzling on a hot stone plate, sisig is a favorite pulutan (beer chow) among Filipinos. The meat is primarily chopped up parts of the pigs’ face — in the Philippines, no cut of the animal goes to waste. Some recipes use either mayonnaise or raw egg (to be mixed in while hot) to give it a creamier texture but the classic way is to incorporate pig’s brain into the dish.</p>
            <ul id="mixes">
                <h3 id="set1">Ingredients</h3>
                <li>1 ½ kg pork head (ear, face, tongue and cheek)</li>

            <h2 id="test78">Bistek Tagalog</h2>
            <p id="uu">Bistek Tagalog or the Filipino beef steak is a delicious blend of salty, sour, and sweet flavours. Thinly sliced beef is marinated in a mixture of mainly soy sauce and kalamansi, fried, and then topped with caramelised onions. The onions are just sweet enough to cut into and balance the strong salty and acidic tastes infused into the meat.</p>
            <ul id="mixes">
                <h3 id="set1">Ingredients</h3>
                <li>1kg beef sirloin, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>100 ml cooking oil</li>
                <li>2 pcs white onions, sliced in rings</li>
                <li>2-5 pcs small Calamansi, (squeeze the juice)</li>
                <li>1 cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
                <li id="jin">Salt and pepper</li>
            </ul>
            <ul id="mixes">
                <h3 id="fog1">Instructions:</h3>
                <li id="ll1">1. Marinate beef sirloin in calamansi juice, soy sauce and pepper for 30 minutes or more. The longer the better it tastes! Set aside or place it in fridge.</li>
                <li id="ll2">2. After marinating, reserve marinade and separate beef into another bowl. Set aside. Heat pan using medium heat and pour cooking oil. Fry beef sirloin until it turns slightly brownish in color. Remove extra oil, so it won’t be oily.</li>
                <li id="ll3">3. Pour marinade sauce and simmer for a few more minutes until beef becomes tender.</li>
                <li id="ll4">4. Add onion slices and a little bit of salt and a teaspoon of sugar to add taste and turn off heat. Garnish with spring onions.</li>

        <p>Hi! We're Team Kaycee’s Filipino Cookbook. Kick back, stay a while, won't you? When you visit our corner of the internet, we want you to feel comfortable. Like did we just become best friends?! kind of comfortable. We're not here to shame you into making Dunuguan when all you really want is Bicol Express. And if you do attempt that dish and fail spectacularly, we're not going to tsk-tsk you—because we've had plenty of OH, S#!T moments, too. 
        </p>
        <p id="fi">That's not to say we're not serious about food. If you've come here to finally tackle an exasperatingly intense sourdough recipe, we can help explain the technique, step by step. We celebrate anyone who really loves to eat as much as those who actually get in the kitchen to cook. So wherever you fall on that spectrum, you'll find your people here.
        </p>
        <p id="lo">That's why we want you to get to know us, too—the team behind Kaycee’s Filipino Cookbook. Scroll through to meet the people who work hard to bring you the recipes you see every month. We want you to love reading on and cooking from Kaycee’s Filipino Cookbook as much as we love creating this space for you, so holler if you've got something you want us to know. We're all ears. (Did you know you can request recipes as well as comment on all our recipes, too?)</p>
